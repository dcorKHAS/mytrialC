//This file is a "Hello, world!" in C for introduction to programming course.
//In the comments, it will give a brief story of how the source code is compiled and executed.
//I will erase all comments above this before handing it to students.


//Hi! Welcome to the world of C programming language.

//This file is a source code file. It is a text file that contains C statements. 
//It was somewhere in your hard drive. Now it is in your computer's memory because you opened it in an editor.
//A file is a collection of bytes. A byte is a number between 0 and 255. Each byte is a character. 
//For non-English characters, we need more than one byte.
// You can tell how many bytes per character by looking at the encoding of the file.
// Most common encoding is UTF-8. It uses 1 byte for English characters and 2 bytes for non-English characters.
// It achieves this by using the first bit of the byte to indicate whether the next byte is part of the same character or not.
// So it can encode 2^7=128 characters with 1 byte and 2^14=16384 characters with 2 bytes.
//A C statement is a command that tells the computer to do something. 
//This something can be anything from printing a text to the screen to calculating a number. 

//In this file, we will print a text to the screen.
//By printing we mean that we will send a text to the screen so that the user can see it. 
//We will not send the text to anywhere on the screen. You will see the output of the program in the terminal.
//Terminal is a program that allows you to send commands to the computer.
// In day to day use you do not interact with the terminal because we have graphical user interfaces (GUI) like Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
// Before such GUIs were developed, even the home users used to interact with the computer using terminals.
// We still use terminals to interact with the computer because it is much faster than using a GUI and it is more flexible.
//Most IDEs provide a terminal for you to try your code, most of the time that is what we will be using

// Which brings the critical question?
// What is a program?
